    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The real estate market plays an essential role in our economy, in some way or another at some point we are touch by its behavior. People that mostly care about the trending values of this market are buyers, sellers, renters, investors and many others, and for most of us, when we first consider purchasing a home, we relate its price to the number of rooms, kitchen style, yard space, living room area, etc. a property has. However, we will find out through this dataset,  that other factors can influence the negotiations and prices when it comes to purchasing a real estate property. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a regression model that can more accurately predict the price of residential homes given the different homes' features and weather data available to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client\n",
    "The analysis is for business client Keller Williams Realty, Inc.; the model serves to better estimate the prices of real estate properties through several homes’ features and yearly weather. The practical value come as sharper report analyses for agents, investors, business owners and general practitioners of the real estate business, providing stronger negotiations in the sales, purchases and strategic agreements in real estate properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Housing\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collected constitute of the “The Ames Housing Dataset” and was originally compiled by Dean De Cock. This data is publicly available and constitue of major characteristics, year and month sale price for each home in Ames Iowa between the year 2006-2009 and part of 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The weather data was obtained from the National Center for Enviromental Information website, it includes daily, monthly and yearly records from different weather stations in the city of Ames, Iowa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  During data analysis, one of the early steps is cleaning our data. This process can help us avoid working with erroneous   data or outliers, which can influence and cover actual or truth values within your model and analysis. Furthermore, our data   needs to take a format in which the predictive model can accept our the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The cleaning process steps for this projects outlined as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   First, we opened libraries and packages needed, then preceded to open data files into DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad Data and Outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "   This project's implementation is through Random Forest and Decision Trees which are not very sensitive to outliers. However, I still wanted to do a quick [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/AlfredMtz/Springboard/blob/master/Ames_project/EDA_for_bad_data.ipynb) to see if there was anything out there that appeared to be error type data.\n",

    "![alt text](z4_testbaddata.png \"CHECKING FOR BAD DATA\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After analysis of a couple key variables, we concluded that nothing was outstanding in regards of erroneous data, so we moved on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Housing data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We had two different data files for housing, one consisted of the home's features, and the other contained the prices. We first attached these two data frames to their corresponding values, then filtered cells to dates between 2006 and 2009; I decided on this range by the most available weather dates in my weather data. And lastly, renamed sale dates columns and built a DateTime index for the homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing Weather Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our weather data files consisted of records from different weather stations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We filtered and subtracted the weather station which provided the best recordings available. Next, the dates were filtered to match our housing dates, and significant weather variables were subtracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrupted values showed as a digit (-999), we changed them through numpy library as NaN(not a number values), then we filled them with the average values of their corresponding variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning and building the data frames, these were joint to form a single data frame file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Conversion to Fit Model Building:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We split the new data frame into our train and test objects. From this point, we filled our train variables' NaN values with means and modes by either being an integer or floating value. Also, for categorical variables, we built dummy columns since our model works only with numerical points, but not data types such as objects or strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our test data, we preceded to use the mean and mode values from our training data for any NaN value. The reason for this was the fact that we don't know if there will be something different about the new data(test) that can change the basis of our model. And finally, we reindex(transfer) the dummy variables from our training data to capture all the possible categorical columns values into our test set."

We also see how people tend to buy more houses during summer when there is no snow and temperature are higher, probably turning into a seller's market from the increase in homes' demand, and switching to a more difficult negotiation to the buyer in home prices.\n",
